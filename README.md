Hi, I’m Liya Sebastian

👀 I’m a Full Stack Developer with experience in building modern web applications using React, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I enjoy working across the stack, from creating responsive user interfaces to developing backend logic and APIs.

🌱 I’m continuously improving my skills in full-stack development, focusing on scalable architectures, real-time applications, and clean, maintainable code.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack and web application projects, especially those involving React-based frontends and Node.js backends.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me via email or social platforms.
